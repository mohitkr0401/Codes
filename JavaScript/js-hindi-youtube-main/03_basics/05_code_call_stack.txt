1.JS creates Global excution context 
2.Next it creates memory phase
3.Memory phase - In this phase,the variables are set to undefined 
  until the execution phase(next phase) and the functions are set to their definitions.
4.Next it creates the execution phase
5.Execution phase - In this phase,the variables are initialsed to given values and 
  when the function s are called,it creates a memory phase and execution phase for the function 
  just like the main one.

For live demo:
browser > inspect > Sources
create a snippet with few functions and visually experience the call stack.

Returned value is passed to the global environment

Execution context gets deleted as well


ANOTHER EXPLANATION!!

The working of the JavaScript works on three phases:
1. Global Execution Context
2. Memory phase / Creation phase
3. Execution phase

Phase 1: Global Execution Context
The value of `this` keyword is set to Global Execution Context (which is an empty Object in NODE environment, & window object in browser environment)

Phase 2: Memory phase
During this phase, JS engine scans the code and assigns the initial values for the variables , functions, etc.. For variables they are 'undefined' and for functions they are set to their function definition

Phase 3: Execution phase
After the creation phase completed, the execution phase begins where actual values of the variables are set. And when the functions are called it creates a new 'Function Execution' context which consists of two phases (they works same as explained above but only for the particular function scope):
1. Memory phase 
2. Execution phase 
The return value of the 'Function Execution' context is passed to the Global Execution Context

Understand call stack with the help of live demo :
browser > inspect > Sources
1.then create a snippet by clicking on the arrow(>>) next to workspace
2.then write down some functions in the created snippet ,do save them by ctrl+S 
3.Create breakpoints and run the code and keep eye on call stack to visualize how it works.
correct me if there are any mistakes or add to this if something is missing.
